# ember-cli-rails-todomvc

A [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) example integrating [ember-cli-rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/ember-cli-rails) and [jsonapi-resources](https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources)

## Why?

I wanted to create a simple [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) and [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) that relied as much as possible on the default conventions of those projects. 

In particular I wanted to have the following:
- Asset pipeline packaging on the Ember.js application
- [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) for persistence
- [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) as the wire protocol
- [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) for the backend database
